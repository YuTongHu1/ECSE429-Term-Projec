# ECSE429-Term-Project

## Context
The project focused on validating and testing a REST API-based To-Do List Manager application (thingifier) through exploratory, story-based, and non-functional testing methodologies. It involved a systematic approach to uncover documented and undocumented API capabilities, automate user scenario testing with reusability in mind, and assess the API's performance and code quality using dynamic and static analysis tools. The goal was to ensure API robustness, identify areas for optimization, and provide actionable recommendations for improving performance, maintainability, and usability.  



## Teammates
Ying Fei Zang, Yun Shan Nong

## Part A: Exploratory Testing
Conducted Charter-Driven Session-Based Exploratory Testing to identify documented and undocumented capabilities of the REST API, creating scripts to demonstrate functionality and highlight instabilities.
## Part B: Story Testing
Developed and automated Gherkin-based story tests using Cucumber, defining acceptance tests for normal, alternate, and error flows, while ensuring reusability and clean code practices for step definitions.
## Part C: Non-Functional Testing
Performed dynamic and static analysis of the API, including performance testing with stress scenarios and SonarQube analysis to detect technical debt, code smells, and potential performance risks.
